# LLULL COMPILER 
Compiler for a new programming language **Llull**. This language will have the extension *.llull*.

> For more information refer to: https://github.com/jordi-petit/lp-llull-2021

**NOTE** 
Compilation and execution are in macOS syntax. 

## Before Compiling
Make sure to install requirements: python -m pip install -r requirements.txt 

## Compiling
antlr4 -Dlanguage=Python3 -no-listener -visitor llull.g4

## Executing Interpret
Using test file test-exemple.llull

### With main 
python3 llull.py test-exemple.llull
                 
### Without main
python3 llull.py test-exemple-pretty.llull hanoi 3 1 2 3

## Executing Pretty Printer
python3 llull.py test-exemple-pretty.llull

## Available Tests
* test-doubleAssig.llull
* test-dowhile.llull
* test-elseif.llull
* test-exemple-pretty.llull
* test-exemple.llull
* test-exemple2.llull
* test-operatorAssig.llull
* test-string.llull

## Available Variable Types
* Strings
* Integers: *boolean statements will be identified by 0/1*
* Floats
* Arrays 

## Array Manipulation Syntax
* Creating a new array: *array(<variable_name>, <array_size>)*
* Getting value for a given index: *get(<variable_name>, <index_val>)*
* Setting value for a given index: *set(<variable_name>, <index_val>, <new_value>)*

## Conditional Statements
Conditional statements will be identified by the key words 'if', 'else if' (followed by a condition) and 'else'. The code corresponding to the conditional statement starts with '{' and ends with '}'.

## Loops
There are three different types of loops:
* for loops
* while loops
* do-while loops

## Comments
Coments in code can be placed using the charachter '#'.

## Input and Output
read(<variable_name>)\
write(<variable_name>, <value>...): different output values separated by comas

# Extensions Implementades
Extensions that have been implemented to extend the Llull Programming Language and its usability.

## Do While
Do while loops changes the order of execution of the loop. The first iteration of the loops' body is always executed and in posteriority the condition is checked.

## Additional Operators
* '&&': and operator checks that conditions before and after the sign are equal to 1
* '||': or operator checks that either the conditions before or after the sign is equal to 1

## Assignations Using Operators
Two diferent types of *new* assignations have been implemented using operators to simplify the users code. Below are examples on these new assignation formats.

Note: the first type can be used for '+', '-', '*', '/', '%', '&&', '||' where as the second type can only be used in the following cases '++' and '--'. Provided the variables are integers.

###Â Examples: 
**i = i + 1** => **i += 1** => **i++**
**i = i - 1** => **i -= 1** => **i--**

## Else if
Else if provides a similar structure to nested ifs. Using the key word 'else if' allows as many extra conditions as the user wants to be implemented in one if structure following the same format.
